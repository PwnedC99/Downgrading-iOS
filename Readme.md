# Downgrading iOS Firmwares

If you don't know how to downgrade Firmwares (Beta too) then this is for you
Disclaimer: Make sure the by you chosen iOS Firmware is still signed by Apple!
This method does not work with unsigned iOS Versions at all.

## Other requirements

A computer (Mac or Windows both are the same)
iTunes must be installed (already installed on MacOS)

## Needed links

https://ipsw.me (for non-beta Firmware)

https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Beta_Firmware (beta Firmware)

https://www.apple.com/de/itunes/download/ (iTunes for Windows)


## 1. Downloading the IPSW

Open one of the links above and choose the device and iOS Version you want.

```

### Fun Fact: 'IPSW and IPA are two different things, iOS Firmwares aren't called iPA'

## 2. Specifying the IPSW (Firmware) in iTunes

1. Open Up iTunes and Connect your Device to your PC.
2. Unlock your Device and click on "Trust".
3. In the top left Corner next to "Music" your Device Icon will show up, click on it.

4. Hold the 'Option' Key (on MacOS) or the 'Shift' Key (on Windows),
 while holding press on the 'Restore iPhone/iPad/iPod' Key

```

```
5. Click on Restore

## 3. Profit.

If you've done everything correctly then you should be on the iOS Version you chose.
If the restore failed, chances are high that the by you specified iOS Version isn't signed anymore by Apple.
